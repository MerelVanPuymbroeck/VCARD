### Hey,what did you said? V-card?
Yes, V-card! We needed to make our own digital v-card with HTML & CSS so it was a statistic one.
I worked with some different aspects like z-index and different shapes.

### Why?

To learn a bit more about how CSS works

### Did I like it?
Yeah sure! It is not truly how I wanted the v-card look but it's okay for what I learned now about CSS.

### What was your personal Quote on the V-card?
Aha, I knew you probaly wanted to ask this question if you didn't opened the v-card.
